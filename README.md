This C++ project implements an Employee Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system consists of two types of employees: Sales and Engineers. The classes are designed to demonstrate key OOP concepts, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation and abstraction.
